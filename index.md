Maybe you've heard about [Hawk-Eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawk-Eye),
a system that tracks a tennis ball with immense precision using multiple cameras.

Dove-eye is an experimental project that attempts to track visually distinctive
object with multiple consumer-grade webcams and reconstruct its 3D location.

**Update** There is also a [related project](https://github.com/JankaSvK/thesis) that
reimplements Dove-eye in Python and extends it with various object tracking
methods.
